# MyStatGenToolbox
Various scripts/functions I've implemented during my PhD in Statistical Genetics.  

Each script is likely to have particular dependencies (like other functions or specific format for input) but I'll do my best to clarify how things work.  

Eventually I'll add scripts for submitting tasks in _sge_, the grid cluster in Oxford Biomedical Research Computing (BMRC) facility.
